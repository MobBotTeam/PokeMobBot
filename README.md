## Dear users
We have changed our Project Lead. Currently, our Project Lead has big plans for our new PokèMobBot and for you, the community, we want the best.  The team was being held back from advancing in things like new bot features, website, and community forums. All donations that have been received has been poorly managed by the previous TL(Team Lead), as of now, any donations will go directly to make PokèMobBot and the community a bigger and better movement.
<br /><br />
Our staff has been working vigorously since launch to help you, the members, with your problems on discord to get the bot up and running to maximum potential.  Even to this day, we work around the clock to make sure you received the help to fix any issue you receive on your end and publish a resolution. We want to implement a website forum, and a ticket base system so that we can assist you better and more efficiently.
<br /><br />
 Development has big features that they want to implement into PokèMobBot. This is time-consuming in coding and stressful work our development team goes through every day to produce quality work to make PokèMobBot more user-friendly and more efficient.
<br /><br />
The goal in sight is to become more transparent as a team and community. Implementing internal release(s), beta testing among donators, helpers, and moderators to produce a proper public release. So that we can minimize these current issues you all are experiencing. Our web forms will allow us to document preexisting and current issues with their resolutions.
<br /><br />
All in all, none of this would have been achievable without the support of you all, and we thank you. You all have turned this project into a beast of its own and we're excited to see the future together.
<br /><br />
Kind regards,<br />
PokèMobBot Team
